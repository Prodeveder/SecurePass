# SecurePass

### Introduction
SecurePass is a secure and easy-to-use password manager designed to store and manage your passwords and sensitive information. With SecurePass, you can generate strong passwords, autofill login credentials, and protect your data with end-to-end encryption.

## Top 3 Features of SecurePass

1. **Secure Password Storage with End-to-End Encryption**
   - This is the core feature. All stored passwords and sensitive information must be encrypted using robust encryption algorithms like AES-256, ensuring that only the user can decrypt the data.

2. **Password Generation**
   - A built-in password generator that creates strong, unique passwords based on user preferences (length, symbols, etc.) is essential for improving security and ensuring users don't reuse weak passwords.

3. **Autofill Functionality**
   - The ability to automatically fill in login credentials on websites and apps enhances user convenience. This feature can be implemented via browser extensions or mobile app integrations, making password management seamless.
